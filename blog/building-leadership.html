<h1>Building Leadership Through Service and Creativity</h1>
<p class="date">November 22, 2025</p>

<p>
  This year, I have taken on several key roles and projects that reflect my commitment
  to community service and student leadership. As the president of my school’s National
  Honor Society chapter, I coordinated a range of initiatives designed to support
  local needs and strengthen school involvement.
</p>

<p>
  Our chapter successfully carried out two food drives, a clothing drive, and a
  pet-supply drive. In addition, I helped organize movie nights and bake sales that
  served both as community events and fundraising opportunities. One of our most
  notable achievements was raising approximately $320 for a local clinic, demonstrating
  what a small school can accomplish with focused effort.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond NHS, I represent my grade as a class representative on student council, where
  I contribute to discussions, planning, and decision-making for school activities.
</p>

<p>
  In parallel with these responsibilities, I am preparing a submission for the 2026
  New York Times writing competition. My topic explores why acting should be included
  in school curricula, highlighting its benefits for confidence, communication, and
  creativity.
</p>

<p>
  This year’s work has given me experience in managing projects, collaborating with
  peers, and balancing leadership with academic and creative commitments.
