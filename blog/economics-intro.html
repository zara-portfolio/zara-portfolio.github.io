  <div class="container">
    <p>Economics is one of the most fascinating subjects because it helps explain how the world works — from how we make money to why prices rise or fall. I recently started learning about the basics, like supply and demand, scarcity, and opportunity cost.</p>

    <p>I watched a video from Khan Academy that explained how every choice we make has a cost — not just money, but what we give up to do something else. It made me realize how economics is really about decision-making in everyday life.</p>

    <p>Over time, I want to learn more about how businesses, governments, and people use economics to make smarter choices. It's like the study of balance — between what people want and what’s available to give.</p>
