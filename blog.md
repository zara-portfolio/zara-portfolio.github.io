## 🏁 Why I'm Interested in Formula 1

Ever since I watched my first race, the sound of the engines and the screech of the tires have fascinated me. From engineering to endurance, Formula 1 has it all. My favorite teams are **McLaren** and **Ferrari** — McLaren for its speed and style, and Ferrari for its rich history.

I'm particularly focused on learning more about **aerodynamics** and **pit stops** in Formula 1, since both play a huge role in race strategy. Recently, I attended the **F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix** held in Baku. To say it was exhilarating or a dream come true wouldn't do it justice.

The Azerbaijan Grand Prix was full of dramatic crashes, tight turns, wild weather, and well-deserved podiums. *Expect the unexpected, indeed.*
