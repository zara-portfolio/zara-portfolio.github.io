    <p>Ever since I watched my first race, the sound of the engines and the screech of the tires have fascinated me. From engineering to endurance, Formula 1 has it all. My favorite teams are McLaren and Ferrari, due to McLaren's speed and style, and Ferrari because of its rich history.</p>
    <p>I'm particularly focused on learning more about aerodynamics and pitstops in Formula 1, since pitstop strategy and aerodynamics play a huge part in Formula 1. Recently, I attended the F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix held in Baku. To say it was exhilarating or a dream come true wouldn't do it justice.</p>
    <p>The Azerbaijani Grand Prix was full of dramatic crashes, tight turns, wild weather, and well-deserved podiums. Expect the unexpected indeed!</p>
