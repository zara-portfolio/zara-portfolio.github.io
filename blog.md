🏎️First Post- Why I'm Interested in Formula 1

Ever since I watched my first race, the sound of the engines and the screech of the tires have fascinated me. From engineering to endurance, Formula 1 has it all. My favorite teams are McLaren and Ferarri - McLaren for its speed and style, and Ferarri for its rich history. 
I'm especially interested in learning more about aerodynamics and pitstops in Formula 1, since both play such a huge role in Formula 1. Recently, I attended the F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix held in Baku. To say it was exhilirating or a dream come true wouldn't do it justice. 
The Azerbaijan Grand Prix was full of dramatic crashes,tight turns,wild weather, and well-deserved podiums. Expect the unexpected indeed.
