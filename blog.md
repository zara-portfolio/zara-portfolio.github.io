🏎️First Post- Why I'm Interested in Formula 1

Ever since I watched my first race, the sound of the engines and the screech of the tires have fascinated me. From engineering to endurance, Formula 1 has it all. My favorite teams are McLaren and Ferrari — McLaren for its speed and style, and Ferrari for its rich history.

I'm particularly focused on learning more about aerodynamics and pit stops in Formula 1, since pit stop strategy and aerodynamics play a huge part in the sport. Recently, I attended the F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix held in Baku. To say it was exhilarating or a dream come true wouldn't do it justice.

The Azerbaijan Grand Prix was full of dramatic crashes, tight turns, wild weather, and well-deserved podiums. Expect the unexpected, indeed.
